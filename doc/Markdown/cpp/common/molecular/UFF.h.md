# UFF.h

The `UFF.h` file implements a universal force field (UFF) for molecular systems based on the article "J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 25, 10024â€“10035". It provides functionalities to evaluate and optimize interatomic forces in molecules using bonds, angles, proper dihedrals (torsions), and improper dihedrals (plane inversions). The class is designed for efficient evaluation of the force field both serially and in parallel using OpenMP.
