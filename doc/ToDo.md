# To Do first

 * Define one option of `iTheory`, `idogs` etc., which functions in `ASSEMBLE` a `INTERACTIONS` are always essential to asseble hamiltonian (and overlap matrix)?
 * Try build something which assemble some minimalistic Hamiltonian

## Minor

 * rename spanish names of files and subroutines `unocentros`, `doscentros`, `trescentros`
