# FireCore C++ Folder Handbook

The \`cpp\` folder is a core component of the FireCore project, housing the C++ implementations of various functionalities. It is structured into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a revised breakdown based on the observed file structure:

**1. \`apps/\`**: Contains source code for standalone C++ applications.
    - \`apps/EFF/\`: Likely related to an "Effective Force Field" application. (Further exploration needed)
    - \`apps/MolecularEditor/\`: Source code for a molecular editor application. This probably uses libraries in \`libs/\` and potentially \`common_SDL\` for UI.
    - \`apps/RFF/\`: Likely related to a "Reactive Force Field" application. (Further exploration needed)
    - \`apps/CMakeLists.txt\`: CMake build configuration for applications in this directory.

**2. \`apps_OCL/\`**: Contains C++ applications that utilize OpenCL for GPU acceleration.
    - \`apps_OCL/MolecularEditorOCL/\`: An OpenCL-accelerated version of the molecular editor. Likely depends on \`apps/MolecularEditor\`, \`libs_OCL/\`, and \`common/\`.
    - \`apps_OCL/CMakeLists.txt\`: CMake build configuration for OpenCL applications.

**3. \`Build/\` and \`Build-dbg/\`**: These are build directories, likely generated by CMake. 
    - \`Build/\`: Contains build artifacts for a release build.
    - \`Build-dbg/\`: Contains build artifacts for a debug build.
    - These directories are not part of the source code structure but are essential for the build process. They contain Makefiles, CMake caches, compiled objects, and executables.

**4. \`common/\`**: Houses common C++ utility libraries and header files used across different parts of the project. This is a crucial directory providing fundamental building blocks. It appears the utilities are implemented directly within header files in this directory.
    - \`common/argparse.h\`: Header for argument parsing utilities.
    - \`common/arrayAlgs.h\`: Header for array algorithms.
    - \`common/browser.h\`: Likely related to in-application browser functionality (needs further investigation).
    - \`common/commandTree.h\`: Header for command tree data structure, possibly for command-line interfaces or scripting.
    - \`common/constants.h\`: Defines global constants used throughout the project.
    - \`common/datatypes_utils.h\`, \`common/datatypes.h\`: Headers defining common data types and utility functions for data type manipulation.
    - \`common/globals.h\`: Defines global variables (use with caution, might indicate areas for refactoring).
    - \`common/Interfaces.h\`: Header likely defining common interfaces or abstract classes.
    - \`common/IO_utils.h\`: Input/Output utility functions.
    - \`common/libUtils.h\`: General library utilities.
    - \`common/LuaClass.h\`, \`common/LuaHelpers.h\`: Headers for Lua scripting integration. This suggests FireCore might support Lua scripting for extensibility.
    - \`common/macroUtils.h\`: Header for useful macros.
    - \`common/repl.h\`: Likely related to a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) interface for interactive use.
    - \`common/script_parser.h\`, \`common/ScriptLang.h\`: Headers for script parsing and a scripting language (potentially related to Lua or a custom scripting language).
    - \`common/test_globals.h\`, \`common/testUtils.h\`: Utilities for testing.
    - \`common/CMakeLists.txt\`: CMake build configuration for the \`common\` library.

**5. \`common_resources/\`**: Contains resource files used by the C++ code, such as data files, images, and Lua scripts. (Same as before)
    - Data files (\`.dat\`): \`AngleTypes.dat\`, \`AtomTypes.dat\`, \`BondTypes.dat\`, \`DihedralTypes.dat\`, \`ElementTypes.dat\` - These likely contain parameters and definitions for force fields and molecular mechanics.
    - Image files (\`.bmp\`): \`dejvu_sans_mono_*.bmp\` - Font bitmaps, likely used for UI in SDL applications.
    - \`GAFF_parameters.ods\`: Spreadsheet file (OpenDocument format) containing GAFF (Generalized Amber Force Field) parameters.
    - \`.lvs\` files: \`NaCl_*.lvs\`, \`polydiacetylene.lvs\`, \`polymer-*.lvs\` -  Likely structure files in a custom \`.lvs\` format (needs investigation).
    - \`utils.lua\`: Lua script, potentially for utility functions or configuration.
    - Subdirectories: \`common_resources/cl/\`, \`common_resources/common_resources/\`, \`common_resources/functions/\`, \`common_resources/mol/\`, \`common_resources/NaCl_1x1_L3/\`, \`common_resources/NaCl_sym-center/\`, \`common_resources/xyz/\` - These likely contain further resource files organized by category (needs further exploration).

**6. \`common_SDL/\`**: Contains C++ utility libraries specifically for SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) based applications. SDL is a cross-platform library for multimedia and graphics. (Same as before)
    - \`common_SDL/browser_sdl.h\`: SDL-specific browser functionality (related to \`common/browser.h\`).
    - \`common_SDL/CMakeLists.txt\`: CMake build configuration for \`common_SDL\`.
    - \`common_SDL/GLUtils.h\`: OpenGL utility functions for SDL applications.
    - \`common_SDL/SDL_utils.h\`: General SDL utility functions.
    - \`common_SDL/SDL2/\`, \`common_SDL/SDL2OGL/\`: Likely contain SDL library headers or build configurations.

**7. \`libs/\`**: Contains core C++ libraries. It appears the library source files are directly within this directory.
    - \`libs/quadrature_lib.cpp\`: Source file for a quadrature library (numerical integration).
    - \`libs/CMakeLists.txt\`: CMake build configuration for libraries in this directory.

**8. \`libs_OCL/\`**: Contains OpenCL-accelerated C++ libraries.
    - (Content needs further exploration) - Likely contains OpenCL implementations of algorithms, potentially for force field calculations or molecular dynamics.

**9. \`libs_SDL/\`**: Contains SDL-specific C++ libraries.
    - (Content needs further exploration) - Potentially UI components or SDL-specific utilities.

**10. \`sketches_SDL/\`**: Likely contains simple SDL-based sketches or example applications for testing or demonstrating SDL functionalities.
    - (Content needs further exploration)

**Dependencies within \`cpp\`:** (Same as before)

- \`apps/\`, \`apps_OCL/\`, \`libs/\`, \`libs_OCL/\`, \`libs_SDL/\`, \`sketches_SDL/\` all depend on \`common/\` for basic utilities and data structures.
- \`apps/MolecularEditor/\` and \`apps_OCL/MolecularEditorOCL/\` depend on libraries in \`libs/\`.
- \`apps_OCL/\` and \`libs_OCL/\` depend on \`common/\` and OpenCL.
- \`common_SDL/\`, \`libs_SDL/\`, and \`sketches_SDL/\` depend on \`common/\` and SDL libraries.
- \`apps_SDL\` applications would depend on \`common_SDL\`, \`libs_SDL\`, and \`common/\`.

**Further Exploration:**

To create a more detailed handbook, we need to explore:
- The contents of \`libs_OCL/\`, \`libs_SDL/\`, and \`sketches_SDL/\` directories.
- The internal structure and purpose of applications in \`apps/EFF/\` and \`apps/RFF/\`.
- The resource files in \`common_resources/\` subdirectories like \`common_resources/cl/\`, \`common_resources/mol/\`, etc.
- The functionalities provided by header files in \`common/\` (e.g., by reading some of them).
- The source code in \`libs/quadrature_lib.cpp\`.
