## Fireball Code Structure Documentation

This document outlines the structure of the Fireball DFTB Fortran code, based on the provided file listing and analysis.

### Overall Philosophy of Fireball (as inferred)

Fireball is a Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) code, characterized by:

1.  **Numerical Atomic Orbitals (NAOs):** It utilizes pre-calculated, spherically symmetric numerical atomic orbitals as its basis set. These are typically generated from atomic DFT solutions and are not analytical functions like Gaussians.
2.  **Pre-calculated Integrals (`Fdata`):**
    *   Two-center integrals (overlap $S_{ij}$, kinetic energy $T_{ij}$, and parts of the potential) between NAOs on different atoms are pre-calculated and stored in tables (e.g., in a directory named `Fdata`) as a function of interatomic distance.
    *   Three-center integrals, crucial for more accurate XC functionals and charge-dependent effects (like in McWEDA), are also pre-calculated and tabulated, depending on the geometry of the three atoms.
    *   One-center terms, especially for exchange-correlation, are also pre-calculated.
3.  **Tight-Binding Framework:** The Hamiltonian matrix elements are constructed using these pre-calculated integrals, often involving interpolation and rotation of these tabulated values to match the actual molecular geometry.
4.  **Self-Consistent Field (SCF):** The electronic structure is solved iteratively:
    *   An initial guess for atomic charges (or electron density distribution) is made.
    *   A Hamiltonian is constructed based on these charges.
    *   The Schr√∂dinger-like equation $Hc = eSc$ is solved to get new orbitals and energies.
    *   New charges/density are calculated from the new orbitals.
    *   The new and old charges are mixed, and the process repeats until self-consistency.
5.  **Approximations for XC and Self-Consistency:**
    *   **Harris Functional:** The **Harris Functional** (also known as Harris-Foulkes functional) is a non-self-consistent (non-SCF) approach that approximates the total energy of a system using a superposition of neutral atomic charge densities. It avoids the iterative self-consistency loop, making it computationally very efficient, especially for obtaining initial energy estimates or for systems where a full SCF treatment is not strictly necessary. While not fully self-consistent, it provides a robust and often surprisingly accurate first approximation.
    *   **Sankey-Niklewski (SNXC):** The **Sankey-Niklewski (SNXC)** method represents an early self-consistent field (SCF) scheme within the tight-binding framework. It was a foundational step towards incorporating charge self-consistency into FIREBALL, allowing for a more accurate description of charge transfer effects compared to non-SCF methods. However, it had limitations, particularly in its treatment of exchange-correlation (XC) interactions, which led to the development of more sophisticated approximations.
    *   **McWEDA (Multi-center Weighted Exchange-correlation Density Approximation):** The **Multi-center Weighted Exchange-correlation Density Approximation (McWEDA)** is a significant advancement in FIREBALL for accurately calculating exchange-correlation (XC) matrix elements. It addresses deficiencies found in earlier approximations (like SNXC) by employing a multi-center approach and weighted densities, which allows for a more precise description of the XC potential and energy. McWEDA is crucial for improving the accuracy of the self-consistent field (SCF) calculations within FIREBALL, particularly for systems with complex electronic structures.
    *   **Kohn-Sham Grid:** A **Kohn-Sham Grid** refers to a real-space numerical grid commonly employed in conventional Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes to perform numerical integrations, particularly for exchange-correlation terms. While FIREBALL's core methodology prioritizes efficiency by largely avoiding a real-space grid for its primary charge density and potential calculations (relying on local-orbital basis sets and tabulated integrals), the framework does allow for the use of a real-space grid for specific parts of the XC problem. This can enable the use of more standard and potentially more accurate DFT functionals, albeit at a higher computational cost compared to the highly optimized, grid-less approximations like McWEDA.

**Summary of Default Behavior:**

By default, Fireball is set up to run a **DOGS SCF calculation with McWEDA XC** for an **isolated molecule/cluster** at the **Gamma point**. It will attempt to achieve charge self-consistency with a tolerance of $10^{-5}$ using Anderson mixing (implied by small `bmix`) and a Fermi smearing of 100K. Forces will be calculated, and a geometry optimization or MD run will proceed for 100 steps with a force tolerance of $10^{-4}$ Ha/Bohr (or equivalent). Output will be minimal. This setup is a reasonable starting point for many molecular systems. For periodic solids, `icluster`, `lvsfile`, and `kptpreference` would need to be adjusted.
