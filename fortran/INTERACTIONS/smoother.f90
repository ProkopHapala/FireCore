! smoother.f90
! Program Description
! ===========================================================================
!       This is the smoother function.  The smoothing function is 
! smoother(r,rbegin,rend).  We define our answer as 
! smoother(r)*exact + (1 - smoother(r))*longrange.
! We also define x=frac=(r - rbegin)/(rend - rbegin) is some equations
! The following are the requirements for a sane smoother function:
! smoother(rend)=0
! smoother(rbegin)=1
! dsmoother <= 0    (smoother never increases)
! These are the requirements for a sane dsmoother:
! dsmoother(rend)=0
! dsmoother(rbegin)=0
! The following are nice to have:
! You might like symmetry: stn(x) = 1-stn(1-x)
! The maximum value of abs(dsmoother) to be small, reduce noise in derivatives
! Quick to evaluate on the computer: not (cos(pi*x)+1)/2.
!
! There are different functional forms:
! (1-x^n)^m is the "old" method
! Which obeys the requirements for n,m>1.  It is the smoothest
! for n,m=2 (smallest possible values).  Thus, a generic forth-order polynomial
! might be a better choice, since n,m=2 is 1 - 2x^2 + x^4 (no x or x^3 terms).
! A forth-order polynomial is the "new" method, but the above conditions
! force it to be of the form:
! 1 + 0x + (n-3)x^2 + (2-2n)x^3 + nx^4
! Where n must be within [-3,3], inclusive.
! For n=1, you recover the "old" method.
! To minizize abs(dsmoother), n is set to zero.
! To make symmetric, n is set to zero
! To get second-derivatives to be zero at x=0, n is to 3
! To get second-derivatives to be zero at x=1, n is to -3
!
! Finally, if you want to get second-derivatives to be zero at x=0,1 because
! you are doing a hessian, then you need a higher-order function.
! 1 + (-10-n)x^3 + (15+3n)x^4 + (-6-3n)x^5 + nx^6
! For symmetry, and mininizing abs(dsmoother), n=0 is probably best.
! This is not implemented.
!
!
! Now a word about choosing xi
! E = Sf + L(1-f),  where S=short, L=long, f=smoothing function.
! Note that this is well-behaved (xi>0), since E is bound by S and L.
! But what about derivatives (ie. forces):
! E' = S'f + L'(1-f) + Extra term.
! Which is well-behaved, except for the extra term which makes it:
! E' = S'f + L'(1-f) + f'(S-L)
! Keeping f' small is good, which is achieved by making xi smaller.
! Keeping (S-L) small is good also, which is achieved by making xi bigger.
! Clearly some sort of balance must be achieved, when choosing xi.
