## Rigid and Relaxed scan
 - allows to select any DOFs to constain (e.g. position of size of electrons/atoms)
 - allows to select any DOFs to monitor ( e.g. position of size of electrons/atoms, pairwise distances and angles) 

## Projections of electrons
 - project electrons along some lines (e.g. edges of tetraherdon between atoms)
 - project electron on cartesian coordinates oriented acorgin to bonds ( e.g. for H2O we have x-axis along bisector of angle between H-O-H, and z-axis perpendicular to this plasne)
   - Gaussian orbitals can be easily integrated along cartesian axis
 - project electrons angularly ?
